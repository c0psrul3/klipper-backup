[homing_override]
gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute in place of G28 commands
#   found in the normal g-code input. See docs/Command_Templates.md
#   for G-Code format. If a G28 is contained in this list of commands
#   then it will invoke the normal homing procedure for the printer.
#   The commands listed here must home all axes. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#axes: xyz
#   The axes to override. For example, if this is set to "z" then the
#   override script will only be run when the z axis is homed (eg, via
#   a "G28" or "G28 Z0" command). Note, the override script should
#   still home all axes. The default is "xyz" which causes the
#   override script to be run in place of all G28 commands.
#set_position_x:
#set_position_y:
#set_position_z:
#   If specified, the printer will assume the axis is at the specified
#   position prior to running the above g-code commands. Setting this
#   disables homing checks for that axis. This may be useful if the
#   head must move prior to invoking the normal G28 mechanism for an
#   axis. The default is to not force a position for an axis.
